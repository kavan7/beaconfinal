**What could anyone possibly want for Valentine's Day other than to be bundled up with a warm drink watching a feel-good romcom?** The answer is nothing. Everyone wants this. Every single person desires a romantic comedy when the cold February weather hits to warm their hearts and that's a simple fact. The romantic comedy genre is recognized as a sub-genre of comedy known for its humour, romance, heart, and mostly lighthearted plotlines. It's also the best genre, although I may be a little biased. If you're a non-believer or a romcom hater, you just haven't watched enough high-quality ones. If the name Hugh Grant doesn't ring a bell, you are severely lacking in the romantic comedy department. And if you do recognize the name and still lack faith, hold out hope because surely there's something on this list for you… hopefully. I have compiled a list of four of the most supreme rom-coms of this century, so you can continue (or begin) to enjoy this sacred genre. This list was skillfully curated so that it could entertain even the most anti-romantic around. If you don't fall head over heels for the genre like me, I can at least promise that you'll be entertained for an hour or two. Now get ready to have your heart won over and a good laugh.  
  
  
**10 Things I Hate About You**  
I couldn’t say my recommendation list was complete if I didn't include this. Not to be overdramatic, but this movie means everything to me. To me, this movie is what *The Godfather* is to wannabe cinephiles. No one but Heath Ledger and Julia Stiles could have played Patrick and Kat - point blank period. Concerning the plot, *10 Things I Hate About You* is a modern take on Shakespeare's *The Taming of the Shrew*. The story revolves around two sisters: Bianca, a popular highschool freshman, and Kat, a rebellious senior.  
  
  
Their father says Bianca will not be allowed to date until her older sister does, which to her means likely never. Enter Cameron, a boy with a long-held crush on Bianca who is determined to get Kat to date so he has a chance with his crush. He pays Patrick - the school’s infamously rebellious loner - to date Kat, and things take off from there for both Bianca and Cameron and Kat and Patrick. Two romances in one movie, you’re welcome. This movie is so brilliantly funny and thoroughly entertaining that you will not be able to pry your eyes from the screen for its 97-minute runtime. You’ll wish you could watch it forever.  

   
**Mamma Mia!**  
Mamma Mia is so good that not watching it is doing yourself a disservice.  
This movie is peak entertainment, and trust me, as someone who has wasted countless hours trying to find one, a better musical doesn't exist. The vibrant Mediterranean ambiance paired with the ABBA soundtrack will have you wishing you were there singing with Donna and the Dynamos. On a beautiful Greek island, Sophie is about to marry her fiance but feels there's one thing missing: she doesn't know who her father is. Around the time Sophie was conceived, her mother, Donna, had relationships with three different men. Desperate to have her father walk her down the aisle, Sophie decides to secretly invite the three men to the wedding in hopes of figuring out which one is her father. Of course, her mother has no idea until they arrive… many songs are sung and consequently lots of misunderstandings are had.  
  
  
Also, I cannot say whether or not to watch the sequel because I am an avid hater of part-twos. I think they’re money grabs that leave you with a bad taste in the mouth but that is a topic for a completely different article. Anyways, I will be rewatching this this February the fourteenth and many others after that. (to the tune of ABBA’s hit “Mamma Mia”)  Mamma Mia, “I could never let you go”!  
  
  
**Notting Hill**  
My final recommendation could be nothing other than a Hugh Grant movie, obviously. Notting Hill is a movie I love not for the romance, but for the protagonist and the setting. William Thacker is a charming yet slightly awkward bookstore owner in Notting Hill or his “favourite bit of London.” After a chance encounter with a famous movie star, Anna Scott, his life is essentially turned upside down. Their romance must bridge the chasm between William’s mostly-normal life and Anna’s glitzy Hollywood existence. Surprisingly, the romance in Notting Hill is one of the least attention-grabbing plots: I found William's life to be refreshing in its ordinariness. His long-term friendships and quirky roommate really breathe life into the story and make it so much more enjoyable to watch. But the true star of it all is the film's namesake - Notting Hill: a picturesque neighbourhood where the majority of the story takes place. Known for its colourful houses and cobblestone streets, I found it added an extra layer of whimsy and warmth to the film. With all of the drama that happens throughout this movie, I loved that the setting did something no one else could - stay consistent. You’ll have to watch it yourself to find out what I mean by that.  
  
  
There you have it: my totally-official-best-romantic-comedies list. Now all I can say to you is indulge in the joy! Get ready to enjoy this cold season with one - or all - of these rom-coms to warm your spirit and heart!
