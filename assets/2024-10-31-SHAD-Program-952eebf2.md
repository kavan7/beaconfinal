Are you curious or passionate about something?  Have you felt an itch to explore new ideas, meet like-minded people, or have just been bored with what you learn in school? If this sounds familiar, Shad might be just what you need!
Shad.ca describes itself as a “month-long, Pan-Canadian, STEAM and entrepreneurship summer program for grade 10 & 11s.” It takes place every July on 20+ Canadian university campuses. 
This past summer, Aidan, Kavan, and I participated in the Shad OnCampus program, with Aidan at Memorial University, Kavan at Ontario Tech, and me at Mount Allison. Read on for advice, anecdotes, and more reasons to Shad in an interview with MCI’s very own “Shaddie Baddies!”  
  
  
**“How would you describe Shad in 3 words?”**  
Aidan: “Life changing experience.”  

Kavan: “Unique, engaging, empowering."  
  
How Shad-bulous! Personally, I would describe Shad as an “incubator for growth.”  
  
  
**“How has Shad influenced your career aspirations?”**  

Aidan: “While SHAD didn’t change which career I want to go into, it gave me a lot more ideas for things I could do on the side. We had talks about counting penguins in Antarctica, biology, biochemistry; lots of fun stuff. It’s good to know that’s out there.”  

Kavan: “It opened up more potential paths I could go down. For example, we had a bunch of lectures on bioinformatics, which I thought was really cool. I thought it was interesting how I can incorporate that with my career as a social justice lawyer.”  

Aidan: “It also gives you a good idea about how education is ongoing. Lots of our lecturers would go to university for one thing, and then completely change their career path.”  
  
  
I agree! One of our guest speakers - a Shad alum themselves - studied engineering, did a pHD in machine learning, worked in broadcasting for eight years, then did her MBA, worked in management consulting and now is creating an engineering faculty at UPEI! Very inspiring stuff. 
Shad campuses are different, ranging in size, content, and structure. However, they all offer guest speakers, field trips, unique educational experiences, and marquee events, such as the design project in which students are tasked with tackling complex problems using STEAM solutions and a design thinking framework. This year’s theme was “How might we help everyday Canadians integrate affordable and reliable green energy sources into their everyday lives to create more sustainable communities?”  
  
  
**“What did you do for your design project?”**  
Kavan: “Our group created a battery made of wood, substituting lithium, an unsustainable component, with lignin, a byproduct of papermaking.”  
  
Aidan: “My group created  “PowerPulls,” a weightlifting machine that generates energy. The winning design at my campus was a passive air conditioning unit which relies on natural gas laws to cool high speed wind for “automatic air conditioning.”  
  
  
Having so many diverse minds in one room researching and ideating was definitely a personal highlight of Shad. But I don’t want to spoil too much! The best part of Shad is what you don’t know. At my campus, we would learn our “Shadule” the day of, and our affectionately repeated mantra was “Trust the Process.” (I also was “unplugged,” meaning I exchanged my normal phone for a flip alternative for the month - highly recommend!)  
  
  
**“What advice would you give to students considering Shad?”**  
  
Aidan: “Definitely apply. Everyone has something they end up liking at Shad.”  
  
  
**Would you recommend Shad?**    
Aidan: “Of course! It was a great experience. Everyone is skeptical when they say it's a ‘life changing experience’ when you go in, but in the end, it's definitely worth it. You learn a lot and meet new people.”  
Kavan: “I agree. You’re really not going to get this type of experience anywhere else. If you want to do big things in the future, this is a very good stepping stone. Opportunities are exponential!”  
Aidan: “At the very least, if all else fails, you still learn about a university you could potentially go to.”  Did you hear that grade 10 and 11s?! Yes, you! Go apply NOW!
