&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**We’ve all been there before.**  
You’re staring down the barrel of a test tomorrow, entirely unprepared. Maybe extracurriculars have swallowed up all your time, you hate the coursework, or you’re the latest victim of *that* popular mobile game. Procrastination has taken hold of our generation, including myself, who has resorted to last minute cramming more and more throughout high school. No matter the cause, your situation is salvageable and, with a good strategy, you can save yourself from a drop in your grade. Through some research and lots of experience, here’s the study plan that has helped me, and can get you results with just one night of studying.

Time is not on your side, so be picky about what you devote your attention to. Is one lesson common sense? Skip it. Was some material covered last year? Don’t bother. Look through everything else you need to know using lesson slides or your notes, and hand-write the information you don’t remember, including definitions, instructions, and problem-solving tips. It doesn't need to be neat or extensive; two pages at most. Writing notes by hand goes a long way to commit content to memory without active recall.

Use your review worksheets or assigned textbook work and complete two practice questions from each lesson, one simple and one difficult. For each incorrect answer, attempt another similar question correctly and move on. If you don’t understand the question at all, flag it and move on. The idea here is practice over perfection. Working through all possible questions with this approach will solidify your understanding of the content while avoiding spending hours scratching your head at small sections of the material.  
  
  
**CHRONO 1:45**  
  
  
Backtrack to the questions you couldn’t solve and reach out for help. Chances are it’s late, so take advantage of online resources like Google, ChatGPT, and Photomath for explanations or step-by-step instructions. If you get conflicting answers from the textbook and online, use your best judgement, knowing both could be wrong. If you still don’t understand a question, move on after fifteen minutes. A couple of lost marks won’t make or break your test score.  
  
  
**CHRONO 2:15**  
  
  
Wrap it up or attempt more practice questions where you are struggling. However, prioritize sleeping well and getting to class early if your test is first period. Talk to classmates before the test on the day of, and tell them to ask you any questions they’re struggling with. Try answering their questions concisely, with clear instructions. Look at your notes afterwards to find ways to improve your answer. Working with another person will expose you to more questions that could appear on the test and is the last wall of defence for any surprises.  
  
  
I don’t support last-minute cramming. I hope I never have to stay up past midnight to study again. However, as cramming feels progressively more inevitable, I believe these four steps are helpful tips to keep in your back pocket. This study method works for almost any course, but remember to adapt to your teacher’s advice and the subject. Above all, take your test with confidence knowing you understand most of the material, and accept your fate, as procrastinators always fall short of perfection.
