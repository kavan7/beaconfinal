Love Languages	

What is your type? And by type, I mean your favourite type of romantic movie.  Is it the kind of movie that focuses on secret repressed love?  Or do you prefer grand speeches and interrupted weddings? I think that the best romantic movies can do both.

For me, 3 movies that accomplish both feelings exceptionally well are French director Jacques Demy’s film *The Umbrellas of Cherbourg*, Hong Kong director Wong Kar-Wai’s film *In the Mood for Love*, and French Director Édouard Molinaro’s *La Cage Aux Folles*.  Don’t be alarmed that these movies are not in English - there are subtitles!

1) *The Umbrellas of Cherbourg* is a musical about 2 young lovers who are torn apart by the French-Algerian War.  From the movie's vibrant color palette and infectious jazz score, it should be no surprise that this is the movie that inspired Daimen Chazelle to make the Oscar-winning La La Land . 
1) *In the Mood for Love* is about 2 lonely people who meet when they realize that their spouses are having an affair together.  The movie is a masterclass in how to make a movie feel intimate and personal. The framing of each scene makes you feel like you are secretly watching a couple’s private moments, and the performances by actors Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung are drenched in longing and regret.
1) *La Cage Aux Folles* is about what happens when the son of a nightclub owner and his drag-queen partner bring home his fiancée and her ultra-conservative parents for dinner.  This film has been remade in English as a Broadway musical and movie titled *The Birdcage*. It manages to deliver an extremely relevant message about love and acceptance while effortlessly managing to be constantly hilarious.

All these movies can be enjoyed for free on either *Kanopy*, the *Internet Archive* or *Tubi*. MCI, I hope these movies can introduce you to a new love language.
