**BookTok: a simple word combining “Books” and “TikTok,” referring to a community of readers sharing their love for literature and talking about books on social media.** It’s such a simple concept, yet BookTok has been the subject of heated debate for numerous reasons.  

   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of these BookTok controversies involves the emergence and popularity of “spicy” BookTok, the side of the community that reads and discusses books where the primary focus is the intimate part of relationships between characters. Members of this community face a lot of backlash and criticism from other readers on the platform.  
  
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On one hand, this criticism is based on a rather valid concern. Many members of the spicy BookTok community will only read books that contain some level of “spice” in them. It has even become a joke within BookTok to comment on classical books asking what the “spice level” is. There is also the fact that some of these romances are incredibly unhealthy, and they can lead readers into normalizing harmful stereotypes within relationships.
  
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, on the other hand, I don’t think that the amount of hate this community gets is fully deserved. Everyone reads books for different reasons, and just because certain readers enjoy reading “meaningful” books that have literary merit, it does not make them better readers than others. Books are a medium through which we tell stories, and if people want to escape into the creative worlds that books provide, I don’t see a problem with that.  
  
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I see a problem with is obsession, addiction, and the unwillingness to be diverse and open with one’s reading material.  
  
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another popular idea on BookTok is that books are becoming too similar to each other and feel one-note, with authors reusing the same ideas and tropes from previously popular books to become the hottest new BookTok sensation. While I do believe that there are certainly many books written this way, I think that they are proportionally overrepresented and discussed on BookTok. In reality, there are hundreds of new books released every day that are original and creative, they are just more difficult to see recommendations for and find.  
  
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a broader and more general scale, I think that there are a lot of positive aspects of Booktok. After all, in an ever-increasing digital and technological world, books as a form of media are slowly phasing out, and people aren’t reading as much as they used to. BookTok is encouraging people to enjoy reading again and is even, to an extent, revitalizing the publishing industry. In Canada, operating revenue for book publishers rose 8.3% from 2020 to 2022, largely due to social media and influencers (Statistics Canada).
