3, 2, 1, Happy New Year! With every Times Square ball drop, our childhoods get further and further from us, and nostalgia rises up to take their place… The late nights of waiting for Santa paired with the early mornings of ripping open presents don’t quite feel the same anymore. Now there are things to do, responsibilities to take care of, and the consequences of age weighing us further and further down. The Christmas mornings which were once filled with laughter and innocence are now blinded by the busyness of life. During the youthful years of childhood, your parents filled the house with Christmas magic; stockings on the staircase, and what seemed like an infinite amount of presents underneath the tree. The level of excitement you had at the age of being naive and carefree about the world, unfortunately, will not come back. Change is a massive part of life. You can reminisce on happier times, but they are not reality. Nostalgia is truly a strange feeling, as it mixes the happy memories we once made with the fear that we might never feel that way again.  
  
  

As the dirty gray slush soaks your winter boots, you reminisce on the fluffy, delicate snow we once had. Where did it all go? The everlasting days of childhood filled with joy, the snow arriving regularly every year - it feels like it’s all gone. The reason for this is the cruel reality of life and the selfish human activities which led us to climate change.    
  
  

Over the years, you may have noticed the snow arriving later and later, the news reports of a not-so-slow rise in temperature during the summer, and new records being set for the warmest heat waves ever: these are all direct results of climate change. What is climate change? It's the slow, long-term rise in temperature that usually occurs naturally, but with the increased use of fossil fuels, is now speeding up rapidly. Climate change, if it continues to happen at its current rate, poses many risks to every form of life on Earth. Throughout the last century, average snowfall and global ice levels have sharply decreased due to rising temperatures caused by climate warming. Rapid rising temperatures pose a massive threat to life as we know it, so please try and be green - not only for snow, but for your future.  
  
  
While the future may sometimes feel bleak, it’s important that we don’t become too weighed down with anxiety and guilt. If you need to feel festive and the present festivities don’t feel up to par, here are some ways to get back that holiday spirit.  
  
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**1.**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning on some upbeat Christmas music to listen to with your family and friends can raise the spirits immediately.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**2.**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baking Christmas desserts to taste the holiday flavour is a great activity to do alone or with friends to make some new joyous memories.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**3.**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rewatching nostalgic Christmas movies is a way to relive the magical moments you had as a child. Your favourite scenes might still feel the same as they did when you were little.  
  
  
Trying these activities out could uplift your Christmas spirits this year and combat the stress of exam season. It’s important that even if Christmas doesn’t feel like it did when we were little, we all strive to keep the magic of the holiday season alive. Remembering the magic of a white Christmas can help us find it within ourselves to fight for future generations of kids to experience the same magic.
