Being the first person that dies in a horror movie is the ultimate humiliation one can get. Would you like to avoid this embarrassment? If so, this is the guide for you on how to “win” horror movies.  
  
  

**1.   *It (2017)***  
   
Imagine your little brother goes missing, and after further investigation, he is declared dead. These heinous acts continue among other innocent kids for  no rhyme or reason. You and your friends team up to face your fears in order to defeat the clown, Pennywise. Pennywise is someone, nobody, not even your grandmother, would want to meet. Except, your grandmother is old, and has nothing to be frightened by. Yet, you—**you** are the perfect bait. This villainous clown feeds on fear, so bravery is a must. If you come in contact and need to battle him face to face—this may seem odd, but mocking Pennywise makes him become weaker and smaller.

**2.   *Scream \(Film Franchise\)***  

Murders occur one year after the death of Maureen Prescott. These deaths connect to your friend, Sydney Prescott, as her loved ones get killed by a mysterious villain named Ghostface. Who is the murderer—or should I say, who are?  
  
  
Throughout this franchise, Sydney Prescott was targeted throughout movies 1-4. While Ghostface’s goal was to take down our final girl, several characters died in the process. Do you really want to die by the hands of a murderer because of your connections with a friend? If not, stay away from Sydney! Even a distant connection with Sydney Prescott can put you in danger, so it’s best to leave Woodsboro and stay away from this slasher icon. If you do find yourself stuck in this mess, make sure to follow Randy Meeks’ rules on how to survive Ghostface. Remember, trust no one! home.  
  
  
**3.    *Candyman, Beetlejuice, Talk to Me***  
  
From talking to a mysterious green haired man, to the hooked figure who controls bees, to playing around with a spirit embedded hand that causes a character’s demise, Beetlejuice, Candyman, and Talk to Me carry a pattern in their evil mockery. It’s the start to all of the messes that take place. In every movie listed, the characters’ cowardly mistakes start the plot of fatality and mental destruction. They all choose to summon the evil spirits and creatures.  
  
  
So… how do we escape this mess? Simple: DON’T SUMMON THEM! It is not necessary to say Candyman or Beetlejuice 3 times. You would never catch me saying Bloody Mary three times in the bathroom, so there is NO WAY I’d have the guts to even utter Candyman’s name or hold hands with a possessed clay figure. Even if you do, you can easily handle Beetlejuice, but if you summon Candyman… good luck!  
  
  
After visiting Pennywise, Ghostface, Beetlejuice, and more, be confident when saying “I could beat these movies easily.” Hopefully this guide was helpful and you feel more protected in your home. Who knows, maybe you’ll end up in a situation like the characters in these movies? Wait… what’s that behind you?
