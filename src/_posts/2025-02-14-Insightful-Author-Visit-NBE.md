Recently introduced and taking the place of “typical” Grade 11 English (ENG3U), NBE3U - or Understanding Contemporary First Nations, Métis, and Inuit Voices - allows Grade 11 students to critically view literature through an Indigenous lens and features opportunities to read and engage with Indigenous authors, one of the most engaging being author visits. As this semester wraps up, let’s look back on three of these visits.  
  
  
David A. Robertson visited us on a Tuesday afternoon in October; a fortuitous opportunity as he happened to be in the city for a book tour. A Manitoba native, Robertson is an award-winning author, having written more than thirty books for children and young adults, including *Black Water* and *The Theory of Crows*, which are course material for NBE students.  Stephanie Gharoro read a personal land acknowledgement and Nathan Mayers served as a student facilitator and interviewer.  
  
  
Mayers states that preparations for the interview were “a collaborative process that allowed for me to be a better voice for our NBE cohort” and that Robertson was “very approachable” and provided “very thorough” answers. Robertson and Mayers discussed the importance of action and intentionality in land acknowledgements and of diverse storytelling as the foundation for truth and reconciliation.  
  
  
Our second author visit came from Waubgeshig Rice, an Anishinaabe-Canadian author based in Sudbury, Ontario, who started his career as a journalist. He has written three novels and one short story collection, notably New York Times Bestsellers *Moon of the Crusted Snow* and its sequel *Moon of the Turning Leaves*, both of which were studied in NBE. Visiting us online on November 28th, he discussed his journey to become a writer, his writing process, the bridge between traditional oral and literary storytelling, and his advice to young writers. Daniel Mok and Romika Taher served as a student facilitator and gave a personal land acknowledgement, respectively.  
  
  
Visiting us on December 13th was Amanda Peters, a Mi'kmaq Associate English Professor at Acadia University and author of *The Berry Pickers*. She spoke on her writing practice, Indigenous joy, and her unpublished work to be published in 2025. Penny McClement shared a personal land acknowledgement, and Ishani Patel acted as a student facilitator. Patel expresses that the most impactful part of facilitating was “hearing the inspiration for her [Peters’] stories,” such as her experiences working with an Indigenous group to ensure their access to clean water and her father’s experiences growing up as a berry picker. Her biggest takeaway, Patel says, is the importance of continued learning about topics and themes found in Indigenous literature: “even if the books are fictional, the themes aren’t.”
