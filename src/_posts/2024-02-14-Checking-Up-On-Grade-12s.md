Checking up on MCI's Grade 12's - Rababb Pannu, grade 11

MCI’s Grade 12s have finalized their post-secondary plans and will soon be on their way out of high school! They’ve been through a lot in almost 4 years at Martingrove, and they definitely have a lot to say. Before they leave, let’s see how some of your favourite MCI seniors are doing!

*Jenna Eshesh (SAC President and Leadership Purple Counsellor):*

**Rababb** - “How are you enjoying being SAC president?”  

**Jenna** - “When you see people enjoying the events you have spent weeks planning and perfecting and you see them having a good time, all of the hard work and time and effort that goes into it is worth it!”

**Rababb** - “What events are you looking forward to during your last year at MCI?”

**Jenna** - “I’m most looking forward to MCI’s Semi-Formal. This is my first time taking part in a big event like this for the school and I’m so excited to see how it turns out!”

Jenna is definitely working hard for our school, and tomorrow, February 15th, is Semi-Formal, where the SAC’s hard work is finally going to be shown off!

*Skyler Xiang (Beacon-Editor-In-Chief and SAC Vice President):*

**Rababb** - “How is the stress of grade 12 compared to previous years of high school?”

**Skyer** - “Weirdly enough, I think I was more stressed in Grade 11! That was a year where I was adjusting to lots of new things— working two part-time jobs, running a club for the first time, and the big academic shift from Grade 10 to Grade 11. Plus, I knew I wanted to apply to university early, so I put a lot of extra pressure on my grades. Grade 12 is surprisingly a bit better, now that I'm used to all of those things. The beginning of the year was definitely stressful, because I was very focused on my grades for university. Now that I've received my offers, however, I'm just trying to stay above my conditional offer average, and I've unfortunately started my Senioritis  affliction a bit early!”

Wow, two part-time jobs, running a club, and getting good grades! That sounds like a handful for a grade 11 student, but at least now Skyler is having a breezy senior year!

**Rababb** - “How do you keep the Beacon so successful?”

**Skyler** - “I don't! The Beacon (or rather, the BEAKon) is run by a Canada Goose named Geraldine who lives in the secret room on the second floor of the MCI Library. I wouldn't try to find her though…”

Woah, Skyler just exposed the Beacon’s secret! It’s true, Geraldine has been running the Beacon from the start, and it isn’t changing any time soon.

*Aleksa Misic (Math Club and Chess Club President, Leadership Rocks and Ropes BLT):*

**Rababb** - “How do you do so well in Waterloo Math Competitions?” 

**Aleksa** - “I’m just better. I think everyone needs to overcome that skill gap and be smart and have skill.”

Wise words spoken by Aleksa. I’ll make sure to follow his advice so I don’t fail the next Waterloo math contest (again).

**Rababb** - “How much sleep do you get as a grade 12 with aspiring dreams to go to the University of Waterloo?”

**Aleksa -**  “*[laughs]* Good one. IJBOL (I just burst out laughing). All I’ll say is it’s a non-zero real number.”

I had to ask Aleksa what “IJBOL” means, and it sounds like he’s lacking in the sleep department of his life. Alas, it seems to be paying off with his crazy math contest scores.

All of these grade 12s seem to be enjoying their final year of high school, perhaps with the exception of Aleksa, however, all of them have worked hard throughout their years at MCI to become members of clubs, academic scholars, athletes, and more. Remember to always strive to be the best, MCI!
