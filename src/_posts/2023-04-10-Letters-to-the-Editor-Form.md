At the Beacon, we strongly believe in the importance of the student body's voice.
While we are a student-run publication, we also believe that opportunities for
non-contributors to share their opinions are vital in upholding the journalistic
principles we work by. All readers of the Beacon are welcome to share their thoughts.
