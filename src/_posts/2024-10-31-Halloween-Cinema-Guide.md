<div style="display: inline; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 18px;">You may be at the age where you’re “too old” to go trick-or-treating on Halloween, but that doesn’t mean you can’t enjoy the holiday in the comfort of your own home. There’s no better way to get into the festive spirit than to watch some iconic Halloween films, so grab your candy, and get cozy on the couch for this list of the best Halloween movies to watch this year.  
  
  
When it comes to Halloween movies, no one does it quite like Tim Burton. The producer, writer, and director has been involved in some of the most beloved Halloween movies, such as *Beetlejuice*, * The Nightmare Before Christmas*, * Corpse Bride*, and * Edward Scissorhands*. These movies all share his signature dark and gothic touch, yet they’re all still incredibly entertaining and filled with humor, so you won't be disappointed if you put one of them on.  
  

Another movie that I have to mention is *Coraline*. This classic creepy movie really is the gift that keeps on giving; no matter how many times you’ve watched it, you will always find new details and secrets that you missed before. The film is riddled with metaphors and symbolism, and its unsettling atmosphere combined with beautiful visuals will be sure to keep you intrigued.  

   
In the same vein as *Coraline*, there are a whole slew of other family friendly animated Halloween movies to watch, such as *Monster House*, *Paranorman*, *Hotel Transylvania*, and *Frankenweenie*. These are all movies that you probably watched growing up, so they have a nice sentimental value to them, and are always great to revisit. Not a fan of animated movies? *Goosebumps*, *Hocus Pocus*, and *Ghostbusters* are all great live action Halloween comedies to watch.  
  
  
If you want something cute, simple, yet so intrinsically fall, then It’s the *Great Pumpkin*, *Charlie Brown* is the right thing for you. This movie is only twenty-five minutes long, but it’ll be some of the most charming twenty-five minutes of your life. It’s also a nice throwback to the past, as the movie came out nearly 60 years ago!  
  
  
In terms of hidden gems, my recommendations are *Spirited Away* and *Werewolf by Night*. *Spirited Away* is great because it’s not directly intended to be a Halloween movie, but it has many spooky/uncanny themes and monsters. And *Werewolf by Night* is a must see because it’s quite new and unknown, but has a very classic Halloween vibe to it and is a fun watch.  
  
  
What’s your favourite scary movie? It might not be something from the *Scream* franchise, but that doesn’t mean that these movies aren’t a great watch this Halloween. These movies are thrilling and filled with suspense to get your heart racing, but they’re also just plain fun to watch. Maybe this year you can binge watch them all!  
  
  
However you end up spending Halloween this year, may you have lots of fun, eat (probably too much) candy, and have a fa-BOO-lous night!
