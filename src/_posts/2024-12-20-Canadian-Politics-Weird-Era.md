Have you ever asked an American their opinion of Canadian politics? You land on one common answer – Canadian politics is weird. While it is ironic coming from our southern neighbours, a bizarre year in Canadian politics has led to unexpected stories and wacky controversies worthy of a soap opera. Pierre Poilievre, leader of the Conservative Party, commands a strong lead in the polls despite unorthodox tactics and eyebrow-raising humour. Meanwhile, incumbent Prime Minister Justin Trudeau hangs on to power by a thread, posting desperate social media comments and protecting a controversial cabinet. As we head into a federal election year, I explore our forehead-smacking political landscape and dive into the weird and wacky side of Canadian politics.  
  
  
&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, Pierre Poilievre  
Pierre Poilievre has gone by many nicknames, including *Skippy* and *The Attack Dog* – however, no label describes him better than *Professional Yapper*. During a House of Commons question period in April, Poilievre announced, “When will we put an end to this wacko policy by this wacko prime minister?” before getting kicked out of parliament for refusing to withdraw the word *wacko*. “WTF”, Poilievre declared at another question period in February, drawing on his inner kindergarten teacher to emphasize each letter.  
  
  
After being told again to withdraw the comment, Poilievre rose to clarify that WTF stood for “where’s the funds?” What else could it have meant?  
  
  
&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still Justin Trudeau?  
When Justin Trudeau was first elected Prime Minister, he was seen as a golden boy capable of rescuing the nation – however, a plummet in popularity has now positioned Trudeau in need of rescuing. In August, Trudeau called on Poilievre to “touch grass” – a feeble comment that fell short of the Gen Z attention Trudeau was reaching for. In another comical mistake, Trudeau chose to support Liberal cabinet minister Randy Boissonnault amid allegations he was operating a business while serving in parliament – an illegal act due to a conflict of interest. Boissonnault lied, claiming the uncovered evidence referred to another Randy in charge. Trudeau knew Boissonnault was guilty, and still decided to stand by him until investigators proved the business employed no other Randys. Yikes.  
  
  
&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Other Guys  
The NDP have had a quieter term apart from their one significant move: pulling support from their supply-and-confidence deal with the Liberals, where the NDP managed to add Russian stock footage into their announcement video. The mistake comes two-and-a-half-years after the Russia-Ukraine war began and a month after they criticized the Conservatives for using stock footage of Russian fighter jets in a video of their own. Classic.  
  
  
When I began writing this article, I was worried I would be short on content. The opposite has been true – many stories were cut, including Polievre and his failed rhyming slogans, another Boissonnault scandal over his falsely claimed Indigenous identity, and the social media rift between the Liberals and Conservatives, where they took jabs at each others’ weirdness. Canadian politics is boiling over with unanticipated scandals, never-ending stories, and more Pierre Poilievre drama than anyone could have asked for. If you ask me, the next Canadian federal election, set for 2025, will be the weirdest yet.
