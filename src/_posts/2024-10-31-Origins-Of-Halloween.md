Have you ever watched Hocus Pocus? If you haven't, this classic movie talks about the origins of Halloween and the mysteries that come on Halloween night. Hocus Pocus and many other Halloween movies often include ideas of witches, black cats, zombies, pumpkins and many more common symbols of Halloween. Stores across Canada sell spooky decor, pumpkins, and costumes, but have you ever wondered why? Why are pumpkins associated with this holiday? Or why is Halloween associated with “fear” or “spookiness”?  
  
  

Well, did you know that this holiday dates back to the 9th century? The night of trick-or-treating, dressing up as your favourite villain, and screaming while watching horror movies started as the Celtic New Year. Over 1000 years ago, November 1, the day of the Samhain festival was recognized as the end of summer and harvest season and the beginning of winter, a dark, cold time connected with death and fear. During this celebration, it was believed that ghosts of the dead came back to revisit their homes and families. However, people dressed up, wearing masks and other disguises, to avoid being recognized by the ghosts. Bonfires and fireplaces were lit to scare away the evil spirits.  
  
  
Along with costumes and spooky decor, the Irish brought a tradition of carving pumpkins to North America. This comes from a Celtic myth about “Stingy Jack”,  a boy who tricked the devil for wealth and riches. When he died, as a punishment, Jack’s soul was left to roam the Earth, among the other ghosts who had returned in the wintertime. Although costumes and bonfires were already there to daunt the ghosts, carving turnips and pumpkins into frightening faces to scare off Jack became a tradition.  
  
  
Halloween has become an exciting holiday that millions of children and adults look forward to each year. Not only is it entertaining, fun, and thrilling, but it is a great excuse to dress up and eat candy!
