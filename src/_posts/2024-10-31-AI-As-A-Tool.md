According to Stanford University, 55% of businesses are leveraging AI to enhance their operations, and it's time for students and educators to harness its potential in the classroom. AI is already beginning to reshape our world, but many students are uneducated in the proper way to use it for school. Artificial intelligence is a great tool, but with great power comes great responsibility.  
  
  
Although it is easy to be tempted to use AI as a quick solution for writing your essays, summarizing content, or answering worksheet questions, this is a terrible idea—not only because you will get caught, but because you won't learn anything. Using AI may be a quick fix, but it leads to a shallow understanding of the ideas and concepts that you are learning, giving you a false sense of security in your knowledge and understanding. Using AI to do your work also takes away one of the best ways we learn and memorize things: forming connections between different subjects, topics, and ideas.  
   
  
But AI is still a powerful tool, so how should students use it and what tools should they use?  
  
  
Using AI to study and deepen understanding of concepts is by far the best way to use it. Large Language Models (LLMs) are great at explaining and teaching students, as well as helping them study for big tests by highlighting main points, summarizing notes, and quizzing the user.  
   
  
Google’s beta product Notebook LM is a great AI tool for students looking to streamline their studying. It's like ChatGPT, but it exclusively draws from the information you upload to it. Those uploads can be downloaded textbooks, notes taken in class, or any other online documents or PDFs. There's a feature called 'Deep Dive Conversation,' where two AI podcast hosts discuss your input in depth. It's a phenomenal tool; highly engaging and incredibly informative. Notebook LM is a great tool for those who are more experienced with AI and better with prompt engineering, as you have more free range and have to tell the model what you want it to do. Atlas.org is another great tool with a lot of very useful features including a problem-solving section, a studying section, and a summarizing section. Atlas.org is best for those with less experience with artificial intelligence and prompt engineering, as it gives you a little bit more structure on what to ask for and how to ask for it. Much like Notebook LM, this model uses the information you upload. This means these two tools will quiz you on the exact information you give them—which means directly from your notes or textbook.  
  
  
Even using more basic tools like ChatGPT can be very beneficial for creating study plans and helping quiz the user on the material given.
But the most important aspect of using AI is prompt engineering: the concept of refining your inputs into these AI models to optimize for the desired outcome. When making prompts there are some good tips to consider; be very specific, add lots of details, and if possible add examples of the format or ideas that you want the AI to produce.  
  
  
Ultimately, AI can be a powerful tool in education, but it is no substitute for hard work.
