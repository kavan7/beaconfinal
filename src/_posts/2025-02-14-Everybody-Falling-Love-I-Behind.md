“I’ve never had a shoulder to cry on, someone to call mine, everybody’s falling in love and I’m falling behind.” (*Falling Behind by Laufey*) The expectation from society and one’s peers to experience young love is incredibly high, but the feeling of missing out on this is very common. Some might consider the definition of love to be holding hands with someone while walking down the hallways, putting formal labels on a two week time period, or even something parasocial. When is it the time to find “the one”?  
  
  
“I want a love like the movies, that’s why I’ll never fall in love.” (*Like the Movies* by Laufey) People's fantasies fueled by the media are a huge reason for the expectation of unrealistic love. Some might even say that the idea of falling in love is better than actually being in a relationship. What you see in the media and television is often either staged or hiding imperfections.  
  
  
Social media only shows you somebody’s highlights, and not truly their reality. Life is something undetermined and sporadic, as is love. Love isn’t going to be like movies, such as *The Notebook or 10 Things I Hate About You*, it will take struggle and communication, things only possible with maturity and emotional availability.  
  
  
“It hurts to be something, it’s worse to be nothing with you.” (*Promise* by Laufey) Toxic and immature relationships are harming millions of people everyday, physically and emotionally. Codependency in romantic relationships is getting increasingly more common the younger people start getting into “serious relationships.” This is not healthy for either partner, especially at such an impressionable age. Emotional availability and having the maturity to talk and have personal space with one’s partner are necessary for maintaining good mental health. Waiting until one feels at a solid point in their life before trying to pursue a relationship results in healthy bonds and a long lasting relationship all around.  
  
  
“I don’t know anything ‘bout love and it’s foolish tendencies, and just like Chet I tend to fall in love too easily.” (*Just like Chet* by Laufey) Are the feelings and messages you’re receiving love or lust? Lust is primarily physical with no emotional connection and can lead to unhealthy addictions for sexual activities. This can deteriorate one’s mental health and views on love, potentially leading to no desire for a romantic relationship. Letting someone use you isn’t a sign of care or love.  
  
  
“Dear soulmate, I can’t wait to fall in love with you.” (*Dear Soulmate* by Laufey) Although sometimes it may feel like love is nonexistent in one’s life, remember, the chances of being born is one in four hundred trillion. These odds are somewhat impossible, and yet you are here today.  This proves that somebody *is* out there, who will understand, know all of your niche references and inside jokes, someone who will fit just right. Love isn’t hopeless.
