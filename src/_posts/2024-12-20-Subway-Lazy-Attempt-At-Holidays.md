Once again, it's that time of year when we have to endure relentless Instagram Reels with that *certain snowman dance*, but more importantly, an onslaught of gimmicky holiday products. Thankfully, this year, Subway answered a call that nobody made and gifted us with their *Festive Faves Meal*. For $8.99, you’re blessed with a 6” turkey sub (featuring “Cranberry Dijon” sauce), potato rings, and two red velvet cookies— quite a deal, I must say. Intrigued, I trekked to my nearest Subway to try it out.  
  
  
First up is the turkey sub, featuring that *interesting* Cranberry Dijon sauce. Remember the lawsuit that Subway got into a few years ago with their alleged “fake” tuna? I would consider doing the same for this so-called “Cranberry Dijon” sauce, because the dijon was totally MIA. The sauce was painfully one-noted, lacking the robust flavour of the advertised mustard, and felt overly sweet. It retained the signature bitterness of cranberries, but didn’t help balance the flavours. The Subway employee also generously provided me with his two cents:  
  
  
**EL:** *How’s the [Cranberry Dijon] sauce?*  
  
  
**Employee:** *[It] tastes just like a fruit, bro.*  
  
  
Our inside man was spot-on with his review: it tasted exactly like a fruit. It could’ve easily passed as a cheap jam for a cheap dessert. He also showed great ineptitude in adequately saucing my sandwich (in retrospect, was he perhaps doing me a favour?). The rest of the sandwich was nothing remarkable: the bread was crisp, the vegetables were passably fresh, and the meat and cheese added necessary sustenance. But overall, this was a <i>sub</i>standard and incredibly lazy attempt at a “holiday sandwich,” which really, might I say, was giving desperate. **Sandwich rating: 2.75/5**  
  
  
The potato rings seemed to hold excess grease, which by extension damaged their crispiness, but not to an effect that might ruin one’s day. The majority of the flavour came from the oil that they were pre-fried in, and I would’ve liked to see them dusted in some seasoning. They weren’t anything more than ring-shaped hash browns, but who doesn’t appreciate fried potatoes? What truly disappointed me was the serving size of only four potato rings, whereas five rings would’ve matched that verse from *The Twelve Days of Christmas (five golden rings)*. Perfect missed marketing opportunity‽ A mediocre product nonetheless. **Potato Rings rating: 3.25/5**   
  
  
I held out in waning optimism for my red velvet cookies. Immediate cosmetic issue upfront: red velvet cookies should be, well, red, and they instead appeared more reddish brown than red. Red food colouring could really go a long way! Colour aside, the textures were <i>sub</i>lime: crisp yet accented with a gentle chew. The dough’s flavour could’ve been a touch stronger, but I appreciated the white chocolate chips, which nicely complemented the lackluster dough. Truly the best item of the three. **Cookie rating: 3.75/5**   
  
  
It would be difficult to claim that the *Festive Faves Meal* was something special, because it wasn’t. It adds to the ever-growing collection of lazy, <i>sub</i>par holiday products that aim to cash in on brainless consumerists and sad 5’5” food reviewers. The need for this promotion was non-existent and so is my wish for it to return. Make my wish come true— and please reimburse me $9 too, Rababb. **Festive Faves Meal rating: 3.25/5.**
