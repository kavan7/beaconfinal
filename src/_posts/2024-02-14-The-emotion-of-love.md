**The Emotion of Love**

By Nathan Tsui grade 12

Love. We all know what it is. But is it all biology, or is there something more? Many people will tell you that love is a biological process; that it’s just pheromones and chemicals in the brain. They’ll tell you that it’s a natural biological response and it’s an evolutionary adaptation that humans developed to survive. However, I think that many of us would disagree. If love was so rigid and straightforward, the things we feel and experience simply wouldn't be true. You could lock yourself up in a hazmat suit, still talk to people, and you wouldn’t experience love. However, this is clearly not the case. 

People who have never met in person before fall in love. People who maintain long distance relationships experience love, even if they’re not physically near each other. Clearly, love is more than just pheromones. 

Although there might be physical processes in the brain that cause us to experience the emotion of love, the actual “feeling” of love is much more personal. Not chemical or electrical impulses, but something more connected.  The philosopher Descartes believed that the mind was separate from the brain—that the brain controlled things like breathing and sleeping, but the mind controlled things like thinking and feeling. Perhaps this is what we experience—love coming from the mind, from feeling. 

Impersonal comparisons tear at the romanticism of love, reducing it to no more than a series of controlled impulses that have been created as a result of simple biology. But I believe love is more than that. I believe that it is more than chemicals, more than pheromones, and more than the body telling the mind what to do. It’s something personal, something that transcends the notion of simple physical processes. What we feel has to be more than biology. Otherwise, we’d be no different than machines.
