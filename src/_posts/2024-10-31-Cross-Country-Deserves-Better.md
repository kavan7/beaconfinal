**“You need to be at least a little crazy to run cross country,”**  
    

is a common saying I hear tossed around amongst non-cross country athletes. I don’t blame them. From the outside looking in, the early mornings, frigid weather, and long commutes to races involved with the sport are anything but appealing. Throw in the bit where you have to run, and I understand the widespread distaste for cross country. Nevertheless, I oppose these flawed opinions.  
  
  
As a cross country runner myself, you might disregard my words as biased. You may be right, but it wasn’t long ago that I grimaced at the thought of starting another cross country season. I’ve only recently gained a greater appreciation for the sport, and I feel it’s something valuable and worth sharing. With the help of three other senior cross country athletes, I hope to convince you that cross country doesn’t deserve its bad rep.  
  
  

Many people point out that cross country is a repetitive sport. They question the point of running laps around a park if you’re not even fast enough to place well. Grade 11 athlete Nicholas Waslander believes cross country is less about placing and more about self-improvement: “I’ve been doing this sport for as long as I can remember, and I like that you can see steady improvement year after year. Every year you’ll come back and get a slightly better result, and the next year you’ll do it again and it’ll be just a little bit better.” Those “small” improvements have amounted to massive change over time and have helped Nicholas lead an active lifestyle.  
  
  
The cold is another common complaint. People tell themselves there's no way they would run in shorts and a singlet in the middle of October, but grade 11 athlete Penny McClement has a different perspective: “I think it's really rewarding to be doing your sport out in nature. That’s what I like more about cross country than track: you’re working hard in a place you love.” While fall weather can be a mixed bag, cross country is one of the last good opportunities to enjoy the outdoors before winter.  
  
  

Lastly, some believe cross country is only for experienced runners willing to drop thousands of dollars on “high-tech” running equipment. Grade 11 athlete Nathan Mayers begs to differ: “Cross country is more available than [more popular] team sports. To be competitive in those sports, you have to start young and have a lot of money to be part of reputable teams. In cross country, I think it's available to anyone.” Having joined the team in grade 9 with no prior running experience, Nathan has not looked back since.  
  
  

I’m not some cult missionary – I don’t believe *everyone* needs to run cross country. *I* didn’t run this season due to a stress reaction from track. However, being one of the smallest teams at MCI, I feel cross country offers more than most people realize. Inside a seemingly tedious and gruelling sport is an opportunity for anyone to better themselves physically in an encouraging environment of hard workers, all while enjoying the outdoors. That, I believe, is something worth sacrificing for.  
  
  
When I was younger, I never ran cross country for the enjoyment of running. But as competition becomes tougher every year, I’ve realized I would still run regardless of my standing. “It’s not about being competitive so much as knowing that I have done my best,” said Penny. As the 2024 season wraps up, our athletes begin to look ahead to track– a precursor to the next cross country season. I invite you to join them.
