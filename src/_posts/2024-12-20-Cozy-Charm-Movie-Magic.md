It’s that time of the year we ALL love—the season of sloppy snowmen competitions, parading through bustling malls, and singing along to the infamous “All I Want For Christmas”. We’ll stick out our tongues to catch icy snowflakes and then burn those same tongues while attempting to drink scalding hot chocolate. But the best part of the holiday season is curling up under my warmest blanket and watching the all-time holiday movie classics. Christmas-themed movies are a staple for December. These beloved films hold a place in our hearts, but what is it that makes them so special? There are three main components to the perfect holiday film - so how do these ingredients mix together to create a recipe for the perfect holiday movie experience?  
  
  
The **atmosphere** is a vital part of a film that carries the holiday spirit. For example, *How the Grinch Stole Christmas* is a journey through Whoville, where in every nook and cranny, no space lacks Christmas decor. Whenever sullen because of the late snowfall, or feeling as if knee surgery were to be tomorrow, just thinking back to how beautifully this film describes winter is enough to lift my spirits.  
  
  
Rewatching these cherished films brings the feeling of **nostalgia**. I remember when my parents refused to watch English movies, but when I suggested we watch *Home Alone*, they wholeheartedly sat through the whole thing. Every 10 minutes, we laughed and cracked jokes about how stupid Harry and Marv were (even though Kevin would’ve tricked us too). I recall all the elementary class parties where we all brought food and watched “Elf” for the 12th time. All the memories these films bring back to us now add to their everlasting magic.  
  
  
The **message** carried within a film also impacts us on a large scale. The short and sweet animation, *A Charlie Brown Christmas*, reminds viewers to celebrate goodwill and the spirit of giving. Messages like these sound cliché, but do we need to overanalyze everything? These precious films bring us good times during the holiday season and that’s all we need. This is your cue to revisit your favorite nostalgic, winter-filled holiday classics.  
  
  
Happy Holidays!
