In MCI’s previous varsity hockey season, our team only brought home one win. This year, losing feels shockingly unlikely. In an interview with the team’s head coach, Mr. Vujacic, he broke down the season thus far, and explained the secrets behind the team's unprecedented success.  
  
  
It’s simple to see: Martingrove’s varsity hockey team has had a significant improvement in performance over the past 5 years. Mr. Vujacic attributes this success to the increase in representative players. “This year, we have more rep players than we've had in the past five years …combined with our select players in grade 12, we have the best team we've had in [a very long time].”  
  
  
Along with these new and skilled rep players joining, one specific addition to the team made an incredible impact, racking up 3 MVP titles in 7 games. “We've got one of the best goalies, maybe the best goalie - at least in terms of his playing so far this year - in the whole city. Aidan Podolski has anchored us and we've been outshot in almost every single game … Aidan has been instrumental in holding down the fort …he's just dumbfounded teams and he's held us in every single game.  
  
  
[When] we play against a team like ECI, [we've] been bottled up in our own end. Aidan has continually saved the day, and then our players have been able to take advantage of fast break counter opportunities, [which has] really been the story of our season.”  
  
  
While MCI’s varsity hockey team may be lacking in skill when compared to the triple-A players of Richview and ECI, the team has shown an incredible drive and motivation when faced with tough competition. Mr Vujacic believes this might just be the key to winning our semifinal game, and finishing second in the west region. “Our team, compared to the other top teams in the west region, on paper [doesn’t] have the same skill level. [If] you just simply look at how many rep players each team has, we don't actually stand a chance, and so, [alike to] the way we've conducted our season, the way we will in the semifinals will be a team first strategy. There are no selfish players on our team. Our players have shown all season that they actually are gonna dig in and use their work ethic and team effort to compete against these other teams, some of which have players that want to do a lot of independent play, whereas our players are truly working together as a team for a common goal.”  
  
  
MCI’s varsity hockey team is focused, determined, and an incredible display of how teamwork and sportsmanship can lead a team to greatness. With a roster of incredible rep players - and a star goalie - Mr. Vujacic is confident that the team will make Martingrove proud.
