<a name="_9fnne6whg7n4"></a>4 Reasons the Ford Government Cares About Politics, not YOU!


Let me start off by saying that Doug Ford is not a man of his word. Doug Ford, the leader of the Conservative party of Ontario and the sitting Premier of Ontario, has backed out on a lot of deals throughout his six years in office. There have 

1. Been numerous examples where he has had a plan, and backed out due to pressure from the public or for political reasons. 
1. He does not think things through. Third,
1. ` `Doug Ford plays to his base. If you’re not a supporter, he doesn’t care. He’s not trying to win your vote. 
1. He cares about politics and power more than the people of Ontario. 

   Let me give you some examples.


## <a name="_m6280ens74tb"></a>Proof of Point 1- He backed out of the Greenbelt deal.
`	`I think this is a very good thing. But, he can be so easily swayed by criticism that he will back out of his backdoor deals once it goes public that he’s done just that. I’m proud of the way investigative journalists found out about these deals as the Greenbelt is a very important part of a sustainable future in Ontario, but, he will back out of anything if it will possibly hurt his chances at a reelection.


## <a name="_e823a2641m7v"></a>Proof of Point 2- He had to recall some pretty bad license plates.
`	`Have you ever seen the dark blue and black license plates? I wouldn’t blame you if you couldn’t, because that’s exactly what happened to Police Officers when they tried to stop people in the dark with those good old Conservative Blue license plates. Looks like they needed a bit more testing, eh Doug? (Let’s not forget when he outright bribed people by “rebating the license plate renewal fee.” In the process, it cost the government billions of dollars).
## <a name="_ujr1va70voro"></a>Proof of Point 3- He reversed his promise to dissolve the Region of Peel once former mayor Bonnie Crombie was elected the leader of the Liberal Party.

`	`This goes for both point one and three. The City of Mississauga has been lobbying forever to separate from the Region of Peel, and finally got the deal done, only to be revoked by our Premier Doug Ford because the Mayor that achieved the independence of Mississauga is now his opponent. About Bonnie, I would like to debunk a few things the Ford Government has been saying in attack ads started by the Ford Government that have been playing constantly over the radio and on TV

1. One rumor started by the Ford Campaign- “She has a house in the Hamptons.” Not true. Her Ex-Husband was given a house in Long Island in a will. She grew up dirt poor, and has paved a career for herself through hard work and dedication. Doug Ford however, has a beautiful cottage in the Muskokas, as well as a house. 

1. Another rumor started by his campaign- “Her 1 Million dollar salary.”: Not true. Her mayor salary is 120,000 dollars a year. She has one of the hardest jobs in the country, works almost 16 hour days, and is always under attack by the opposition. She is the reason the Mississauga City Council has been under control, and productive. When she left, council meetings turned to chaos. Would you not want financial incentives for working such a hard job? Plus, Doug Ford may only be making 400 000 dollars of tracked salary, but with his backroom developer deals, I assume he is making a lot more. For example, he went to the wedding of a major developer’s son, right before he opened the greenbelt for the public to purchase. Guess who was the first to buy land? The developer who Doug Ford had just talked to. These are not fully proven, but from inference, it is easy to see how one could see some corruption there.

## <a name="_lgx993cb9plm"></a>Proof of Point 4- He funds Catholic Schools disproportionately more than Public Schools

`	`Doug Fordknows that most of his voters are Catholic, and that the people who go to Catholic schools most likely have parents that will vote for him. As well, a lot of public school parents can’t even vote! Many parents of students at public schools are recent immigrants, and/or refugees. Almost one hundred percent of parents at Catholic schools have full citizenship. So Doug Ford will build new Catholic schools, so those parents can think, *wow, he’s gettin’ it done for my kids,* not knowing that kids in underserved communities don't get these same opportunities.* Just in my neighbourhood alone, three new Catholic schools are being built from the ground up, while the TDSB is in severe debt. Everywhere I go, it seems that new Catholic schools are sprouting up out of the ground. Ford knows those parents will give him a vote, and since he won so handily last time, why does he have to win the public school vote? I applied for a Catholic school, and even though I had high 90’s in everything, I was rejected because there were “too many Catholic applicants.” It is my local school, but now I am forced to trek all the way to Martingrove(I’m not complaining, I love this school) by taking two buses and a subway, when I could have just ridden my bike to school, just because I wasn’t baptized. 


`	`In conclusion, I would like to say that you don’t have to agree with me on this issue, but I would like to open your eyes as some of us will be able to vote in the next election. So before you blindly put your ballot in the box, think of what Doug Ford has done for you.
