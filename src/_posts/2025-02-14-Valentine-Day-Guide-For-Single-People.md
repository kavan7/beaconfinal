As Valentine’s Day—the day of  flowers, chocolates, and love—approaches, couples eagerly countdown the days. But for others, it’s a different, more disappointing story. Some people *really* don’t want a relationship—which is absolutely fine. However, there's a select few, who, although they say the opposite, deep down, face no other option than remaining single on this romantic holiday. Maybe you want this day to pass by like any other Friday—without any overt public displays of affection. If so, here's a list of the places you should definitely <u>avoid</u> this Valentine’s Day.  
  
  
*1.&nbsp;Flower Shops*  
I’m sure the idea of picking out a gorgeous bouquet sounds rather lovely… unless it’s Valentine’s Day. If you would rather not face the agonizing sight of interlocked hands and watching couples spending money on each other, just stay away from flower shops for the day.  
  
  
*2.&nbsp;Attractions (specifically the Eiffel Tower)*  
Strolling around Paris, gazing at the Eiffel Tower from afar, sounds like a beautiful way to spend a Friday night… but not *this* Friday night. This is a spot you should definitely steer clear of if you’re single. Lots of romantic tourist attractions become prime hotspots for couples on Valentine’s Day. Who could blame them, though, as visiting such places makes for a beautiful way to spend time with our loved ones.  
  
  
*3.&nbsp;Chocolate Stores*  
As someone who could eat a suitcase full of chocolates and remain unaffected , even I would ignore chocolate stores on this day of romantic gift-giving. Undeniably, chocolates are a staple for Valentine’s Day gifts: so much so, that the very day after Christmas, stores are already stocked to the brim with heart-shaped chocolates and candies. Even *if* you choose to put yourself through this misery, by the time you get there, the chocolates might already be sold out.  
  
  
*4.&nbsp;The Movie Theatre (to watch a Rom-Com)*   
Unless you’re actively trying to sabotage your self-esteem, I’m not sure why a (dashing) single would willingly go and watch a rom-com in theatres on Valentine’s Day. Look to your right—couples. Look to your left—couples. Look behind—couples. On the screen? More couples. Opt for horror movies instead—at least then you can cry of fear instead of loneliness… or just stay at home and stream online.  
  
  
*5.&nbsp;Restaurants*  
Dining out at a restaurant is a perfect form of self-care, except on Valentine’s Day when restaurants turn into rom-com sets. Especially if you pick one of those social media-famous spots likely to be swarmed by couples—now *that’s* on you. Maybe try sobbing until a waiter tries to console you. It could be the start of your own Hallmark movie—or get you some free dessert at least.Try less popular restaurants or just order some DoorDash to avoid couples.    
  
  
This list *might* make it seem like single people should lock themselves up in their houses for all 24 hours of Valentine’s Day, but remember: this day isn’t just for couples. Spend time with your loved ones or just treat *yourself* on this special day. Happy Valentine's Day!
