Valentine's Day is fast approaching, which some consider a loathsome day meant to make people spend money on chocolate and cards. But that won’t be you, not this year! Why? Because this time, I've got you covered with a step-by-step guide on how to make a one-of-a-kind, made-with-love card for your loved ones. I think we can all agree, no matter how you feel about this public holiday, that handmade cards are the best cards! 

You can make this card unique and personal by taking the basic design and changing things up, like the colours used, motifs, or messages, to really make it one-of-a-kind.

**HOW TO MAKE YOUR HANDMADE CARD:**

`   `**Step 1** - Grab your White A4 Construction Paper and fold it in half, down the middle horizontally, pressing the fold flat.

`   `**Step 2** - Start from the middle of the card and with your pencil draw a string of hearts varying in size at a curved angle, with the final heart being drawn on the bottom right corner of the card.

`   `**Step 3** - Draw a line outlining the curve of the hearts 0.2 inches away from them. 

`   `**Step 4** - Grab your scissors and cut along the line that you just drew.

`   `**Step 5** - Still holding your scissors, cut the insides of the hearts you drew earlier out, to leave                      you with hollow ones.



`   `**Step 6** - Next, grab your pick of colored A4 paper and fold it in half down the middle horizontally, pressing the fold flat.

`   `**Step 7** - Open your white construction paper card, and glue the colored paper over the pages.

`   `**Step 8** - Outline the hollow hearts in a stitchwork pattern.

`   `**Step 9** - Write wording and messaging inside and outside the card that is to your liking.

`  `Good Luck!
