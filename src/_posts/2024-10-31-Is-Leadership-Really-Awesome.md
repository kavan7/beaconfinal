You have to want to go somewhere really bad to wake up at 6 am. Our destination? McKellar, Ontario. As the school year is well underway, I know many of us are dying for a little respite from the routine. Camp really is as amazing as everyone says it is, and my experience proves it.  
  
  

**A Journey Begins**  
  

Picture this: By 8 a.m., you are on a comfortable bus with friends, the air filled with convivial laughter and that electric buzz of excitement. From the second we hit the road, you know this is going to be special.
One of the most unique elements of Camp Manitou is the colour group assignments. Finding out if you are in red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, pink, or silver adds a fun element, and gives each group its special identity. I was in red - the best group, by the way. Wearing matching gear instantly creates a bond, a part of being in something together. And best of all: the added fun of tutus! Yes, that is not a typo!  
  
  

The actual fun began when we arrived at the campgrounds. We did so many activities, including one awesome challenge known as the "Rocks and Ropes" course, which really changed the game. I remember fumbling in a tight spot and my teammates shouting words of encouragement that got me through it. I'll never forget that feeling of successfully tackling those.  
  
  

**Building Bonds**  
  

Now, a few words about friendships: sharing a cabin with strangers is daunting at first, but those strangers became my closest friends as we enjoyed late-night talks and shared snacks. One evening, we stayed up all night sharing our experiences and fears and were shocked by how much we had in common despite our initial differences.  
  
  

**Camp Life: The Little Moments Matter**  
  

Throughout camp, there were so many little moments that made it special. Roasting marshmallows around a campfire and laughing about our mishaps, and all the while creating lasting memories. It showed how much we bonded through shared experiences.  
  
  

**Delicious Meals and Lasting Friendships**  
  

And the food? So good!  We sat at tables and laughed over spilled drinks and debated over who had the best act at the talent show. Those meals became one of many bonding moments I will always treasure.  
  
  

**Why You Should Go**  
  

The bottom line is this: time at camp is not just a 'break' from school. but an experience through which to grow, learn, and establish friends that may well be lifetime ones. Besides, the skills you learn - teamwork, self-confidence, and creativity - will serve long beyond your time at camp.
So, for any Grade 9s looking to get unplugged from the same old routine, I really encourage you to come on out to camp next year. Take an amazing opportunity to make new friends and see what you're made of! And don't forget to bring your sleeping bag, blanket, and pillow for those chilly nights!
