<div style="display: inline; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 18px;">**“Aren’t you a bit too old to be trick-or-treating?”**  
  
The question rippled across the space between my outstretched palm and the crumpled Doritos bag clutched in the woman’s hands. I couldn’t help but notice that the pointed smile on her face mirrored the artificial grin of my orange pumpkin bucket. As I left the porch, sidestepping skeleton decor and faux cobwebs, confusion and guilt began to seep in. Had the benevolent spooky spirit run out? Had I truly outgrown the most sacred childhood ritual— or worse, was I now just another greedy teenage trespasser trying to snag some free treats?  
  
  
As Halloween approaches, many of us may find ourselves on uneven footing. Dressing up and squealing “Trick or Treat!” past the age of 13 can stir up feelings of embarrassment and disappointment, or even earn you a few glares from parents of mini Elsas and Spidermans. Unfortunately, the alternatives are far from promising; Mean Girls-style Halloween parties don’t quite translate into reality, and staying home to watch a horror flick pales in comparison to the excitement of costumes and candy.  
   
  
Many teens cling to childhood nostalgia as a way of coping with the difficult transition to young adulthood. At a time already rife with uncertainty and mounting pressure to “act our age,” the disruption of traditions such as trick-or-treating can feel like the final nail in the coffin of the carefree kids we used to be. Betrayal ensues as the (formerly) adoring smiles of elderly neighbours indulgently sprinkling Kit-Kats and Smarties into pillowcases fade into distrust of rowdy high schoolers.  
  
  
Halloween nights always carry a tangible magic in the chilled October air. In a world where greed and individualism dominate, the notion of trick-or-treating seems almost ridiculous—free candy? In this economy? Still, the collective agreement to hand out treats to giddy, chocolate-fueled children for one night a year warms my heart, even as I feel myself drifting away from the festivities. It’s a bittersweet reality, and I can’t help the wistful yearning to go back to simpler times as I prepare for my first “grown-up” Halloween. For now, I can only wish this year’s trick-or-treaters bountiful harvests and hope that my fellow high-schoolers find comfort in a batch of pumpkin cookies and a cozy rewatch of The Addams Family.
