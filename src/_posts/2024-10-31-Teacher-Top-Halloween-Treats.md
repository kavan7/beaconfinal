Let’s not kid ourselves; candy is everybody’s favourite part of Halloween, mine included. Unfortunately, my family never strays away from the usual iconic assortment of candies from the Nestle multipacks, so by no means am I a candy aficionado. But unlike myself, some of our MCI teachers have strong opinions about their favourite Halloween candies, which they’ve generously offered to enlighten me with. Big mistake on their part—we’re about to see which teacher has the wickedest taste. 
  
  
In the spirit of Halloween, I instinctively turned to MCI’s most frightening teacher, Mr. Sommerfelt. His favourite indulgence is, get this: cherry Starbursts. He doesn’t share these with his daughter (gaslight, gatekeep, girlboss), and I can see why. I hadn’t touched a Starburst in a hot minute before this, so I was delighted when I was met with that sweet and certainly chemically manufactured cherry goodness. As I chewed through, more of those saccharine cherry flavours released themselves. The unique textural experience should also be noted, as the Starburst transformed from a solid rectangle of sugar into what Mr. Sommerfelt referred to as “chewy bliss.” Overall, a positive start from Mr. Sommerfelt. **Rating: 3.5/5**  
  
  
Upon asking Ms. Chang about her favourite candy, she went in a slightly unconventional direction with her choice of cherry Twizzler Twists. She explained that it’s not the taste, but rather a strong childhood memory that led her to this pick. One of her earliest responsibilities was wrapping cherry Twizzler Twists to distribute to trick-or-treaters. Now, I’ve never been a Twizzlers fan, and this only reinforced that. It was difficult to escape the confusing plasticity that they gave off. The texture felt like I had mini pebbles in my mouth. The taste, reminiscent of children's medicine, felt both sugar and cherry-lacking. Perhaps nostalgia is the most powerful ingredient, but to quote Ms. Chang after one of my music tests, “unfortunately, I have to assign a numerical value to it.” **Rating: 2/5**   
  
  
While new to MCI, Mr. Dunne’s has a timeless favourite: Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups. Upon inspection, great promise was shown for texture. A strong, brittle perimeter of chocolate guarding a soft shell of chunky peanut butter— strong play. For the taste: milk chocolate has always been a no-go for me as I find it too sweet; but these little cups struck a satisfying balance, with the sweet milk chocolate being offset with a salty peanut butter filling. The taste was divine, and so are these cups. FYI, Mr. Dunne is ready to fight anybody who disagrees. **Rating: 3.8/5**  
  
  
So there you have it! Congratulations, Mr. Dunne; I’d be bewitched to receive Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups while trick-or-treating! Sorry to all those with peanut allergies; Mr. Dunne and I pity you. Thanks to all our participating teachers, and thanks for giving me an excuse to eat Halloween candy. Happy Halloween, MCI!
