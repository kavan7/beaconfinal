**Aries** (March 21 – April 19): You will find an unexpected surprise in those Valentine's chocolates… Something tells me it will be red…

**Taurus** (April 20 – May 20): Heartthrob alert! Looks like Cupid’s picked a favourite this year! Expect lots of Valentines coming your way, you lucky duck. 

**Gemini** (May 21 – June 20): You might find yourself swooning over old love letters or daydreaming about your crush! Reality check, they don’t feel the same. 

**Cancer** (June 21 – July 22): Sigh. Looks like you’re stuck with a fairytale case of unrequited love this year, but don’t let that make you crabby! Who knows, maybe your happy ending is right around the corner…

**Leo** (July 23 – August 22): Get all dolled up for Valentine’s day! Make your hair is all nice and wear your best clothes this year. After all, Venus (AKA the planet of love) is in retrograde!

**Virgo** (August 23 – September 22): A certain Aquarius may have their eyes on you……

**Libra** (September 23 – October 22): Sorry Libra, you’ll be all by yourself this Valentine’s, but that's okay! ‘Tis the season for self-love so buy YOURSELF some candy and chillax. Heck, wait until the Valentine’s rush is over, and get them for cheap! Life hack. 

**Scorpio** (October 23 – November 21): The key to rizzing up any Rom-Com lover: *Mamma Mia*, *Love Actually*, and *The Notebook*. Use this knowledge wisely. 

**Sagittarius** (November 22 – December 21): Tone it down this Valentine’s day. We know you’re eccentric, but it’s scaring away any potential Valentines! 

**Capricorn** (December 22 – January 19): W Rizz. 

**Aquarius** (January 20 – February 18): Even though it’s your season, that doesn’t mean you can’t make a grand gesture for your boo! Make a card, buy a cake, watch a movie — you do you!

**Pisces** (February 19 – March 20): You may be alone this Valentine’s, but sometimes, besties are the best dates! Show your friends how much you care by spending this lovely holiday with them.
