This holiday season, I made my way down to the bustling Eaton Centre in the heart of downtown Toronto where I was granted the delightful opportunity to interview Santa himself. Nestled in front of a breathtaking view of the 114-foot-tall Christmas tree, the tallest in North America, I felt like I had stepped into a winter fairytale. Before the interview began, I was mesmerized by a dazzling light show on the tree. The twinkling lights danced along with accompanying music, as fake snow gently fluttered from the ceilings, truly transforming the mall into a winter wonderland. The air was filled with holiday cheer, making it impossible not to be swept up in the holiday magic.

**Me**: What are the hottest gifts that kids are asking for this year?  
  
  
**Santa**: They haven’t been asking for very much. Hot Wheels, though. And also tablets.  
  
  
**Me**: I see! And what’s the craziest thing a kid has asked you for?  
  
  
**Santa**: Oh, what did she ask me for the other day… one was a microwave, and one wanted a sewing machine. A lot of them I’m asking and all I’m getting is “I don’t know”. I don’t know what “I don’t know” is. If you know I would love to know what it is!  
  
  
**Me**: I wish I did. And one final question, what do you have to say to kids that don’t believe in Santa?  
  
  
**Santa**: Well I’ll put it this way. Kids who don’t believe in me anymore? When they have their first child, where is the first place they go to? Me. So in reality, did they really lose their faith in Santa Claus? I don’t think so! I think it’s just a matter… maybe they don’t want their friends to think they’re not cool? I swear, I hold babies just two, three, or six weeks old. That’s why I’m saying, who do they see first? Other than a doctor obviously, but outside of that, I’m the first one!  
  
  
Unfortunately, I didn’t have more time to talk to Santa, as he had quite the long lineup of eager children wanting to see him, but I loved hearing his answers, and I look forward to seeing him flying around the world and delivering gifts to kids this Christmas!
