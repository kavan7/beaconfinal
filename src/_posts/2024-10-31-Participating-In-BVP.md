My experience participating in the 2024 Beaverbrook Vimy Prize was unlike anything I could have ever anticipated. Over the course of two weeks, participants stayed in both Belgium and France, visiting memorials, battlefields, grave sites, and museums. This hands-on learning experience enhanced my understanding of the First and Second World Wars in ways that I’m sure will have a lasting impact. It challenged my preconceived notions of what war truly is and its tremendous effects.  
   
  
For the summer program, the Vimy Foundation selected 14 students, 12 being Canadians from places including Saskatchewan, Alberta, Quebec, Prince Edward Island, and Ontario of course, in addition to one student from Pas-de-Calais, France, and one student from Portsmouth, England. All 14 of us formed incredible bonds that greatly improved our experiences.  
  
  
Every day there was something new to learn and a different perspective to understand. For instance, we learnt a lot regarding the methods and rationale behind certain burial practices for different soldiers during our tours of cemeteries.  
  
  
Sometimes the way a soldier is buried is based on their culture, religion, or the country they served; other times it's because of the individuals who buried them. One of the most interesting cases of this I found was at The Douaumont cemetery, which was  one of the cemeteries we visited in France. Muslim soldiers were buried with their graves oriented towards Mecca, to honor their religion. The many cemeteries we visited and the many we missed opened my eyes to just how large scale the wars were and how they impacted so many people with long lives ahead of them and histories untold.  
  
  
I am especially thankful to our chaperones who helped us with the learning curve of going from knowing the world wars only from inside a classroom to being on the sites where they took place. They were always welcoming of our questions, encouraging and answering them to the best of their abilities. Truly, they were essential guides throughout the entire experience and aided greatly in ensuring we got the most out of those 10 days. This program was nothing short of  life changing. I was exposed to so many 
new ways of living and opportunities that I simply cannot highlight in one article. The main thing I hope some Beacon readers take away from this article is that if you’re interested in world history and travel this is a great summer experience that I would highly recommend you apply to.
