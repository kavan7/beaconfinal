He “ho ho ho”’s into the night, is pulled by 7 reindeers alike, and delivers gifts through chimneys (or doors, because chimneys in houses are expensive) with pure delight. He’s the Santa Claus of North America—and while he is widely recognized for his red suit, white beard, and cheery demeanor, Santa exists in many different forms: each reflecting the local traditions and beliefs of various parts of the world. Here are three of the coolest versions of Santa Claus from around the world.  
  
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;**1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sinterklaas (Netherlands)**  
The Dutch have *Sinterklaas*, who’s basically Santa’s stylish grandfather (he absolutely sleighs). He wears a red bishop’s robe, rides a horse, and sails in from Spain on a steamboat. He’s got helpers called *Zwarte Piet*, who are in charge of delivering gifts and keeping naughty kids in check. Long ago, Sinterklaas was said to keep track of naughty children by spanking them with a chimney sweep’s broom and placing them in a bag to take back to Spain. Thankfully, today in the Netherlands, children can look forward to Christmas without worrying about spankings or abductions.  
  
  
**&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; La Befana (Italy)**  
Italy’s *La Befana* is the one and only female Santa Claus on this list. If I were to stick to the idea of being part of Santa's family, she would be like his cool aunt. Befana is an elderly woman wrapped in a dark shawl, wearing a kerchief on her head, and carrying or riding a broom. Legend says La Befana was too busy sweeping her house to join the Three Wise Men on their journey to find Jesus—then when she had a change of heart, wanting to join them with her basket full of gifts and her broomstick, she failed to catch them. Now, La Befana delivers presents to kids in Italy on January 6th, the feast of the Epiphany.  
  
  
**&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Joulupukki (Finland)**  
*Joulupukki*, the Finnish Santa, could be considered the awkward cousin of Santa Claus, who keeps getting compared to him at Christmas dinner. In early Finnish folklore, Joulupukki used to be a "Yule Goat," a scary goat-like creature that would visit homes during Christmas either to bring gifts or demand offerings from families. Over time, he’s upgraded to a more human physique, very similar to the traditional Santa Claus.
