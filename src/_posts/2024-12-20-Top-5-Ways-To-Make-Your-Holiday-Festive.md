Has Christmas been feeling a little un-festive lately? Absence of snow on the ground getting you down? No need to fear! With Christmas just around the corner, we’re counting down the top ways to turn your holidays into a winter wonderland. If you haven't been feeling the seasonal spirit lately, then join us in today's article as we count down our favourite ways to get festive this Christmas.  
  
  
**Number One:**  
  

From Mariah Carey to Christmas movie classics, there's no better way to get in the holiday spirit than seasonal songs. But if you're getting tired of “All I Want For Christmas is You” on loop, then consider making your own Christmas carol covers to put a unique twist on Christmas.  
  
  
**Number Two:**  
  

Here at The Beacon, we understand the magic of Santa better than anyone… And there's no better way to have a happy ho-ho-holiday than to tell a mall Santa what you want for Christmas! Head down to your nearest Santa and ask him to make your wish come true to relive the best part of the holiday season.  
  
  
**Number Three:**  
  
If a green Christmas has you feeling down, maybe it's about time to DIY a white one. With a few ski hill snowmakers, you can feel the joy and happiness that snow on Christmas Day brings to your inner child. And if you want to experience that snow as much as possible, why not set those snowmakers right in your living room, giving you a truly wintry Christmas morning.  
  
  
**Number Four:**
If you want to make Christmas decorating just that much more festive, why not take your decorating to the kitchen and bake a life-sized gingerbread house that's sure to win you the best dressed house on the block. Pro tip: hot glue works faster than icing!  
  
  
**Number Five:**  
  
 No snow? No sledding? No problem! With a laundry basket, flight of stairs, and a willing sibling, you can create the best winter activity in the coziness of your own home. The screams of holiday joy (or terror) are hard to beat! *The Beacon is not responsible for any injuries sustained by holiday activities.*  
   
  
That's been our top five ways to bring the festive spirit back into the holiday season. We hope our picks have brought at least a little Christmas magic to you and you have a very happy holiday season.
