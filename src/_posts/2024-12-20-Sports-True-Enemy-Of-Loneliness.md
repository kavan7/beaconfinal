For many here at Martingrove, it’s tricky to foster genuine connections with people. Whether it’s because you’ve only arrived recently, or still can’t live down that one mistake from middle school, the feeling of loneliness can be overwhelming. If you’re struggling to find friends, or simply want to be more mentally and physically healthy, MCI’s athletics program might be just what you’re looking for.  
  
  
Getting active has numerous benefits, whether it’s school sports, intramurals, or a new phys-ed class. Increased physical activity can keep your heart, lungs, and muscles healthy, while also promoting a healthier sleep cycle and decreasing your risk of cancer later in life. But there’s more to the story than just your health. Studies show that increased exercise can lead to higher levels of focus, less tension and stress, and feeling less frustration or anger.  
  
  
Engaging in school sports, however, has an added benefit: socialization. The feeling of closeness that typically accompanies regular team sports is amplified when you see your fellow team members in your day-to-day life.  
  
   
Whether you’re in the same classes, eat lunch together, or simply notice each other in the halls, you start to see your teammates everywhere. With this close proximity, it’s a lot easier to reach out and form friendships.  
  
  
Sports help you develop key life skills, such as cooperation and communication. Skills such as these are crucial when one wants to build healthy relationships. Take it from Via Patel, a BAC executive. During an interview, she stressed how team sports contributed to her communication skills: “[Team sports] help me connect with new people because [they] require communication in order to be successful. [Players] always try to support each other to lift each other's spirits, even on days when we lose or something unfortunate happens. Even words of encouragement from my teammates make my mood better.”  
  
  
If you’re struggling to find your place in the school community, sports are a great way to meet new people and get active. But if running and jumping aren’t your style, there are still many other ways to get involved with athletics.   
  
  
Most of these opportunities are available because of our amazing Bears’ Athletic Council.  
  
  
By joining the BAC and becoming a general member, you immediately open yourself up to a different side of Martingrove athletics. Working lines, refereeing at intramurals, and score keeping are only a small portion of the non-active involvement the BAC has to offer. By participating in school sports, even if you’re not the one playing, you can discover the friendly and welcoming environment of Martingrove’s athletic council.  
  
  
It’s easy to feel alone. If you’re a transfer student, or in Grade 9, or just never “clicked” with anyone, high school may feel hostile, or altogether terrifying. But before you decide to throw in the towel and accept that loneliness, I encourage you to explore the sports and athletics department here at MCI. Spring teams, such as tennis and track and field, are ready to welcome you with open arms. In the words of the late Jesse Owens, “Friendships born on the field of athletic strife are the real gold of the competition.”
